      <h1>Raid Rules</h1>
      <p class="sub">These rules are designed to keep raiding fair, clear, and enforceable for everyone.</p>

      <h2>1. Breaching Charge Use</h2>

        <li>Breaching Charges may be used <strong>only</strong> on doors, hangar doors, garage doors, and gates.</li>
        <li>A raid is defined as a break-in using a <strong>Breaching Charge</strong>.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>3. Soft Raiding (Allowed 24/7)</h2>

        <li>Using an entrance that was left open</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. No Griefing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Griefing is prohibited before, during, and after a raid.</li>
        <li>What counts as griefing is decided by admins (case-by-case).</li>
        <li>Examples: unnecessary destruction, making a base unusable, destroying loot on purpose, blocking exits without reason.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Building & Rebuild Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No building during an active raid (this includes placing storage).</li>
        <li>Rebuilding is allowed only <strong>30 minutes after the last door was destroyed</strong>.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>No logging out inside a base that does not belong to you or your team.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>7. Prohibited Actions Related to Bases</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not place codelocks on any part of someone else’s base (gates, doors, windows, storage, any element).</li>
        <li>You may not take over another player’s base (overtake).</li>
        <li>You may not take over another player’s flagpole.</li>
        <li>If a base’s flag is completely down (flag fully lowered), the base is considered abandoned and <strong>dismantling for materials is allowed</strong>.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>8. Excessive Dismantling</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Dismantling bases solely to farm materials is not allowed.</li>
        <li>Exception: if the base’s flag is completely down (flag fully lowered), the base is considered abandoned and dismantling is allowed.</li>
        <li>If a base has already been breached and there is a clear path (e.g., open doorways), you must use that path instead of dismantling additional parts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>9. Raid Recording Required</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must record your raid(s).</li>
